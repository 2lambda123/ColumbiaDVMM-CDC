# CDC

By Zheng Shou, Jonathan Chan, Alireza Zareian, Kazuyuki Miyazawa, and Shih-Fu Chang.

### Introduction

Convolutional-De-Convolutional Networks (CDC) is a deep learning framework for precise temporal action localization in untrimmed long videos.

This code has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with a single NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN X.

Please use "GitHub Issues" to ask questions or report bugs. Thanks.

[comment]: # (Current code is our rough version and we are improving its implementation details, while the current version suffices to run demo, repeat our experimental results, and train your own models.)
